This is Yutong Song, a first-year PhD student at the University of California, Irvine, working under the mentorship of Prof.Amir Rahmani and Prof.Nikil Dutt. From Jan 2022 to Jun 2024, I was a PhD student major in computational science, studies jointly in UCI and SDSU. In SDSU, I did some work on wireless network optimization with the supervision of Pro.Wei Wang. During my undergraduate study in UESTC, I also have several works on information fusion and uncertain information decision with the supervision of Prof.Yong Deng.
